			My name is Harley Johnson. I am an artist and 
		a computer programmer who has enjoyed coding since she was a pre-teen. I am from 
		St. John's, Michigan. I am in my late 20's, looking forward to the greater 
		financial stability that has been said comes with your 30's.
	</p>
	<p>
			I started teaching myself to code HTML when I was about 11 years old. I learned it
			 from a children's site called Neopets.com, where you could create a webpage for your 
			 pet. I thought that was so cool, so I started looking up more and turning the 
			 pages into whatever I wanted. I have also been using a computer since I was 3 years old,
			 when my grandpa introduced me to computer games. From then on, I spent a lot of time on
			 the computer through most of my early life.

	</p>
	<p>	 
			By the time I reached high school coding classes, I 
			 already knew how to make web pages and edit blog layouts. As I learned about VB.net, I soon 
			 became fascinated by actionscript for flash animation, making games, and really
			  anything to do with coding. By the time I took a college level programming course 
			half the school day through the whole year, I was able to fly through it. I 
			  helped teach the other students and received a "Most Outstanding Programmer" award
			at the end of the year.
	</p>
	<p>
		After high school, I became focused on art for a long time. I drew realistic portraits 
		of people. I eventually moved on to animals and drawing in color. I took art classes 
		for a couple years and practiced on my own every day. I have just recently started 
		learning to paint more in oils. Art is a life saver, one of the most relaxing 
		things can be done and one of the most rewarding. If I could more easily make a living on 
		it, I would do so. Fortunately for me, I have other useful talents such as coding, 
		which I'm hoping can help me make a living doing something I love.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, this is me. 
		<br>Thank you for reading and getting to know me.
